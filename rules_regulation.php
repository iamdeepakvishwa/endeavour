						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							<i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green;"></i>DO keep children in tested and approved car seats, no matter how much they beg or plead to get out. If you need, take frequent breaks so that little ones can stretch their legs.

						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							<i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: green;"></i>DO pay attention when you are driving, even if you are familiar with the area. A surprising number of accidents happen only blocks from home!

						</p>

						</p>
						<p align="justify">

					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T drink alcohol and drive, and don't get in a car with a driver who has been drinking or using drugs.
					</p>
					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T make assumptions about what other drivers are going to do. Just because someone has their turn signal on does not mean they are actually going to turn. They may be like the rest of us, and have forgotten that it is on!
					</p>
					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T assume that other cars know what you are doing, either. Make sure that you use your turn signals and give yourself, and the cars around you, plenty of room to maneuver.
					</p>
					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T tailgate other cars, pass on shoulders, fail to yield, run stoplights or stop signs, or break any other rules of the road on purpose. If you act like you are above the law when you operate a car, you will sooner, rather than later, find out that you are not.
					</p>
					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T play your car stereo so loudly that you are disruptive to others, or so loudly that you are unable to hear train signals or emergency vehicle sirens.
					</p>
					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T talk on your cell phone and drive at the same time. If you need to make or answer a telephone call while you are driving, pull over at a safe place, use the phone, and then resume your journey.
					</p><br><br>
					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T treat a car like it is a toy. It is not. Don't use your car to play chicken, race, or give another car a friendly "tap."
					</p>	
					<p class="justify">
						<i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true" style="color: red;"></i> DON'T leave valuables in your car, especially in places where they can be seen, no matter where you are parked.
